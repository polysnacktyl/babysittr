## Application Requirements
Your project should fulfill the following requirements:
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs.
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


## Presentation Requirements

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
* Demo: Show your stuff!
* Directions for Future Development
* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository

Approach:
We used a combination of HTML and CSS to structure our page.  We all love CSS because it gives web developers a more precise level of control over a webpage's layout, typography and overall visual aesthetic.  We were tasked with choosing aframework other than Bootstrap and we chose Bulma, a CSS solution based on flexbox layout.  Inclusive of an extensive range of built in features, promotes faster turnaround and less CSS coding! Javascript enabled us to dynamically code HTML, allowing us to change the page view and add information to the page without making a server request, increasing the overall satisfaction of the UI.  We used two API's that enabled us to fetch data, allowing for an interactive experience with our users as we can pull data based on their previous searches.  The result is an interactive application that allows users to both enter and retreive information.
