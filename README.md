# Approach
We used a combination of HTML and CSS to structure our page.  We all love CSS because it gives web developers a more precise level of control over a webpage's layout, typography and overall visual aesthetic.  We were tasked with choosing aframework other than Bootstrap and we chose Bulma, a CSS solution based on flexbox layout.  Inclusive of an extensive range of built in features, promotes faster turnaround and less CSS coding! Javascript enabled us to dynamically code HTML, allowing us to change the page view and add information to the page without making a server request, increasing the overall satisfaction of the UI.  We used two API's that enabled us to fetch data, allowing for an interactive experience with our users as we can pull data based on their previous searches.  The result is an interactive application that allows users to both enter and retreive information.
